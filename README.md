* The KP781 model is selling a lot more to men (82%) than women (18%). To increase
sales to women, we suggest. Females who prefer exercising equipment are very low
here. To increase sales to women, we should run a marketing campaign on special
deals and trials made just for them.
* As KP781 provides more features and functionalities,This model should be marketed
by influencers and other international athletes portraying that KP781 is specially
made for professionals and athletes.
* The Age group of above 40 years should be targeted to recommend Product KP781.

**2. For KP281 and KP481:**
* It's a good idea to set reasonable prices for both the KP281 and KP481 models.
* By introducing flexible payment plans and options, customers can pay in installments
over a few months, making it easier for customers with lower budgets.

mobile. This app can track how much users run each week, give them feedback on their
progress, and suggest workouts based on their fitness level and goals. This will make using the
treadmill more enjoyable and keep users engaged.
